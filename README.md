# food-menu

This is the 5th project to refresh ReactJs concepts. I am writing an article about ReactJs main concepts so I can share it with the community once it's finished.
This is a menu app. You can choose the category and see what's in the menu.

Topics:

• useEffect() => fetch data. • Conditional Rendering
